Hello from Brent Da Mage!
This is an SDK I compiled containing files utilized to compile certain projects of the 2016 ROBLOX source code.
Please extract this to the Contrib2 folder. If you haven't already, change the CONTRIB_PATH environment variable to the Contrib2 folder. There should already be references to this SDK folder in multiple project files.
