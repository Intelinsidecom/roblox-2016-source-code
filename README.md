## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

- When importing some models or opening places all parts are colored as gray
   - This is due to the source doesn't have Color3uint8 support for the Parts, doesn't happen frequently but however [we will fix it.](https://github.com/P0L3NARUBA/roblox-2016-source-code/blob/db5a53d3a156f30cbde469b801b84b55d65412c6/README.md?plain=1#L84)
